*From: CFO & Operations Manager*
*Date: January 10, 2024*
*Format: Email bullet points*

## The List (As Provided)

1. Approvals should be automatic for small amounts

## The Problems

**Conflicts:**
- Item #7 (email) vs. #12 (Slack) - which one?
- Item #1 (automatic) vs. #5 (managers approve) - what's "small"?

**Vague Items:**
- #3 "fast and easy" - how fast? easy for whom?
- #4 "based on expense type" - which types? what rules?
- #13 "right person" - what determines this?

**Missing Info:**
- No success metrics
- No timeline
- No priority (all seem equal)
- No current pain points quantified

This is the raw input for Scenario 2.
