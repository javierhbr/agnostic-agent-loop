# Scenario 2: From a Requirements List

## Business Context

**Company:** FinFlow Solutions
**Type:** Mid-size accounting firm (200 employees)
**Stakeholders:** CFO, Operations Manager

## The Problem

The expense approval process is manual, slow, and error-prone. Approvers use email and spreadsheets. The CFO has created a bullet-point list of requirements but they're scattered, conflicting, and vague.

## Initial State

A document with 18 bullet points like:
- "Approvals should be automatic for small amounts"
- "Must integrate with QuickBooks"
- "Should be fast and easy to use"
- "Need approval workflows"
- "Email notifications" (conflicts with item #12: "Slack notifications")

## What Makes This Challenging

- Requirements are unorganized
- Some items conflict
- Vague language ("fast", "easy")
- Mix of features, constraints, and wishes
- No prioritization

## Time Investment

~40 minutes to transform scattered bullets into structured PRD
