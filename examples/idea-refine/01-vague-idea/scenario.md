# Scenario 1: From a Vague Idea

## Business Context

**Company:** NotifyHub
**Type:** B2B SaaS platform for project management
**Size:** 50 employees, 2,000 active users
**Revenue:** $2M ARR

## The Problem

Users are missing important updates about their projects. The current system only sends email notifications, which get buried in inboxes. The sales team reports that "better notifications" is one of the top three feature requests from prospects.

## Stakeholders

**Primary:** Sarah Chen, Product Manager
**Secondary:** 
- Marcus Williams, Head of Sales
- The Customer Success team (receiving complaints)

## Initial Request

Sarah has been tasked with improving notifications. She knows users want mobile push notifications, but hasn't defined exactly what that means yet. Her initial brief to the team is simply: "We need push notifications on mobile."

## Current State

- Email-only notifications for project updates
- No mobile app (web-based product)
- Users complain about missing deadlines
- Competitors offer mobile notifications
- No budget for a full native app rebuild

## What Makes This Challenging

- **Vague scope:** "Push notifications" could mean many things
- **Undefined success:** No clear metrics for "better"
- **Uncertain priorities:** Which notifications matter most?
- **Technical constraints:** How to deliver without native apps?
- **User segments:** Different users need different notifications

## Why This Scenario Matters

This is the most common starting point for features: a vague idea that stakeholders know they want, but haven't fully defined. The product-wizard skill helps transform "we need X" into a clear, actionable specification.

## What You'll See

In this scenario, Sarah uses the product-wizard skill to:
1. Answer discovery questions about the problem and users
2. Define specific notification types and triggers
3. Establish measurable success criteria
4. Identify what's explicitly out of scope
5. Create a complete PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria

Then she uses dev-plans to break the PRD into phased implementation tasks, and atdd to generate acceptance tests.

## Time Investment

- **Discovery conversation:** 20-30 minutes
- **PRD creation:** Automated after discovery
- **Review and refinement:** 10-15 minutes
- **Total:** ~45 minutes to go from vague idea to detailed specification

## Expected Outcome

A production-ready PRD that:
- Defines exactly which notifications to implement
- Explains why users need this (problem statement)
- Identifies target users and their needs
- Sets measurable success criteria
- Provides clear scope boundaries
- Includes technical approach (Progressive Web App push)
- Lists user stories with acceptance criteria
