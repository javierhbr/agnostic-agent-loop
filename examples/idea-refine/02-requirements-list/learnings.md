# Scenario 2: Key Learnings

## Main Takeaway

**Structure emerges from chaos through systematic organization.** Scattered requirements become actionable when conflicts are resolved, vague terms defined, and priorities established.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Conflicts Reveal Missing Decisions

The email vs. Slack conflict forced a decision: What's the primary notification channel? This led to a better solution (both, with priority) than either alone.

### 2. Vague Terms Hide Requirements

"Small amounts" means nothing until you define $100. "Fast" means nothing until you specify 4 hours. Precision transforms wishes into specifications.

### 3. Prioritization Prevents Scope Creep

18 requirements ≠ 18 must-haves. Separating MVP from Phase 2 made the project achievable in 12 weeks instead of 6 months.

### 4. Organization Surfaces Gaps

Grouping requirements by category (approval rules, notifications, integrations) revealed what was missing: mobile UX, error handling, audit logging.

## Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Treating all requirements as equal priority
- ❌ Accepting vague language without clarification
- ❌ Avoiding conflict resolution ("we'll figure it out later")
- ❌ Adding everything to MVP scope

## Time Saved

**Before:** Weeks of back-and-forth emails, incomplete specs, rework
**After:** 35 minutes to complete, tested PRD
