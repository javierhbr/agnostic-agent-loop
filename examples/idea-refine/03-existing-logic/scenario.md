# Scenario 3: From Existing Logic

## Business Context

Customer Success team at TechSupport Co uses a manual spreadsheet-based ticket routing process. They want to automate it while preserving 5 years of tribal knowledge and business rules.

## The Challenge

- Existing process has 15 routing rules
- Edge cases handled manually (VIP customers, escalations)
- Need to capture implicit knowledge (not documented)
- Must not break what works

## Key Learnings

- Document before automating
- Preserve business logic exactly
- Test against current baseline
- Incremental migration (parallel running first)

[See prompts.md for how to document existing processes]
