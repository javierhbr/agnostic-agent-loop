# Scenario 3: Key Learnings

## Main Takeaway

**Automation must preserve valuable human knowledge.** Document tribal knowledge before automating, or you'll lose edge case handling that took years to refine.

## Key Lessons

1. **Map current state completely** - Don't assume you know all the rules
2. **Test against baseline** - Automated version must match manual outcomes
3. **Parallel running** - Run both systems simultaneously during transition
4. **Capture the "why"** - Document why rules exist (not just what they are)
