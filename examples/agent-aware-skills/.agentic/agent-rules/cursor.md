# Cursor Custom Rules

These rules are injected into .cursor/rules/agnostic-agent.mdc during generation.

- Use the integrated terminal for running tests and builds.
- Leverage Cursor's multi-file editing for refactors.
- When implementing, check related test files before modifying source.
- Prefer inline completions for small changes, full edits for new functions.
