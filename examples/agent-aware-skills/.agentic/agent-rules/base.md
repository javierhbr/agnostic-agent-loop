# Base Agent Rules

- Always read `AGENTS.md` before starting work in a directory.
- Update `AGENTS.md` if you change the logic/architecture.
- Keep tasks small and focused on a single concern.
- Run `go test ./...` after every code change.
- Use `agentic-agent` CLI for all task and context operations.
