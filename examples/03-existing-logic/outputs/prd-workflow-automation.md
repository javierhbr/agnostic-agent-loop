# PRD: Support Ticket Routing Automation

## Problem
Manual routing takes 15 minutes per ticket. 1,000 tickets/month = 250 hours wasted.

## Preservation Requirements
- All 15 existing routing rules must work identically
- VIP customer handling preserved
- Escalation paths unchanged
- After-hours logic maintained

## New Capabilities
- Instant routing (15 min → 5 seconds)
- Load balancing across agents
- Skills-based matching
