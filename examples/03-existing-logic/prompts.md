# Scenario 3: Prompts for Existing Logic

## Initial Prompt

```
We have a manual customer support routing process that we want to automate. 
I've documented the current workflow. Can you help me create a PRD using the 
product-wizard skill that preserves our business logic?

Current process: [attach current-process.md]
```

## Documenting Edge Cases

```
The current process has these workarounds:
- VIP customers skip queue and go to senior agents
- Escalations override normal routing
- After-hours tickets wait until business hours

These must be preserved in the automated system.
```
