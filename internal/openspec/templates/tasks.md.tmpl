# Tasks: {{ .Name }}

<!-- FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS (delete these comments after adding tasks):
     List tasks as a numbered list or checkbox list BELOW this comment block.
     Do NOT wrap tasks in HTML comments — they must be plain markdown.

     Simple format:
       1. Create database migration for users table
       2. Implement User model with validation

     Detailed format (with task files in tasks/ directory):
       - [ ] Create database migration (ver [tasks/01-db-migration.md](./tasks/01-db-migration.md))
       - [ ] Implement User model (ver [tasks/02-user-model.md](./tasks/02-user-model.md))
