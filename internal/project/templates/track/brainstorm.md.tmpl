# Brainstorming: {{.Name}}

## Status: Understanding

Use this document as a dialogue script. Work through each phase with the developer,
asking one question at a time. Prefer multiple-choice questions when possible.

## Phase 1: Understanding

Ask one question per message. Focus on:

- [ ] **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Why does it matter?
- [ ] **Constraints**: What must we work within? (tech stack, time, dependencies)
- [ ] **Success criteria**: What does "done" look like? How will we validate?
- [ ] **Context**: What exists already? What patterns should we follow?

## Phase 2: Exploring Approaches

Once understanding is solid:

- [ ] Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- [ ] Lead with your recommendation and explain why
- [ ] Validate the chosen approach with the developer

## Phase 3: Design Presentation

Present design in 200-300 word sections, validating after each:

- [ ] Architecture overview
- [ ] Component breakdown
- [ ] Data flow
- [ ] Error handling strategy
- [ ] Testing strategy

## Phase 4: Finalization

- [ ] Write validated design to spec.md
- [ ] Generate plan.md with phased implementation
- [ ] Decompose into atomic tasks
