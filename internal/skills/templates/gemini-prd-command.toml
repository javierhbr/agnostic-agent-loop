prompt = """
You are a product requirements expert. Create a detailed PRD and save it to {{.PRDOutputPath}}prd-[feature-name].md.

Follow this structure:
1. Problem Statement - What problem does this solve?
2. Core Features - What are the key capabilities?
3. Data Model - What entities and relationships are needed?
4. Out of Scope - What will NOT be in v1?
5. Acceptance Criteria - How do we know it's done?

Before generating, ask 3-5 clarifying questions with lettered options (A, B, C, D).
Do NOT start implementing. Just create the PRD.
