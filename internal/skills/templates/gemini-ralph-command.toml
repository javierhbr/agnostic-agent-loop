description = "Convert a PRD to YAML task format for the agentic-agent system."
prompt = """
Read the PRD from {{.PRDOutputPath}} and convert it to YAML task entries in .agentic/tasks/backlog.yaml.

Rules:
- Each task must be completable in one context window (one agent iteration).
- Max 5 files per task, max 2 directories per task.
- Use this YAML format for each task:

```yaml
- id: "US-001"
  title: "[Short title]"
  description: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
  status: "pending"
  scope:
    - "path/to/file1.go"
    - "path/to/file2.go"
  acceptance:
    - "Criterion 1"
    - "Criterion 2"
```

If a task is too large, split it. Right-sized examples:
- Add a database table and migration
- Add a single API endpoint with tests
- Add a UI component to an existing page
